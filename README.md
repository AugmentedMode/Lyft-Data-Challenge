# Lyft-Data-Challenge

## Goals: 

### 1) To Recommend a Driverâ€™s Lifetime Value (the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver)

### 2) Questions to answer:

1) What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value? <br>
2) What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is 
onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft? <br>
3) Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more 
value for Lyft than the average driver? <br>
4) hat actionable recommendations are there for the business? <br>

### 3) Prepare and submit a writeup of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience.
