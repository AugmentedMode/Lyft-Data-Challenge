#### After exploring and analyzing the data, please:
1. Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).
2. Please answer the following questions: <br>
a. What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value? <br>
b. What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is
onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft? <br>
c. Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more
value for Lyft than the average driver? <br>
d. What actionable recommendations are there for the business? <br>
3. Prepare and submit a writeup of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience.
